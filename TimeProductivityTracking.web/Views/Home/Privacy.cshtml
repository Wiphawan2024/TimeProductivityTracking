<h2>Introduction & Background</h2>
<p>
    This web application is designed to facilitate time tracking and productivity monitoring for contractors,
    streamlining activity recording and reporting for both contractors and their employers. The project is based
    on a real-world use case from the <a href="https://www.seai.ie/plan-your-energy-journey/for-your-community?gad_source=1" target="_blank">
        SEAI Sustainable Energy Communities (SEC) programme
    </a>, which currently relies on Excel spreadsheets for
    recording contractor activities.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, SEC County Mentors—contractors engaged through a tendering process—submit three separate documents
    each month:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An Excel sheet tracking planned and achieved person-days per community group</li>
    <li>A Word document summarizing activities</li>
    <li>An invoice in Word, PDF, or Excel format (varies by contractor)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>
    This project aims to replace the existing system with a streamlined web application, integrating the following functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Centralized data entry and storage</li>
    <li>Enhanced productivity tracking</li>
    <li>Automated reporting and data analysis</li>
    <li>A more efficient, user-friendly interface for contractors and employers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits of the New System</h2>
<p>
    The proposed web application will introduce a more structured and integrated approach to contractor activity tracking,
    offering the following advantages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Elimination of redundant manual data entry</li>
    <li>Improved accuracy and consistency in reporting</li>
    <li>Enhanced visibility into contractor productivity and performance</li>
    <li>Automated generation of reports for better decision-making</li>
</ul>
