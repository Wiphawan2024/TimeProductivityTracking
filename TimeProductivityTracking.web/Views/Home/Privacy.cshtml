<p>
    Thank you for visiting the final project page. This section provides an overview of the purpose and functionality of our web application. The project is designed to help users manage and track productivity, generate performance summaries, and simplify invoice creation based on logged work hours. Built using ASP.NET Core MVC, it features data filtering, reporting tools, and user-friendly interfaces to support both contractors and managers in achieving their productivity goals.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The application is built to streamline time tracking and productivity monitoring for contractors. It is inspired by a real-world case within the
    <a href="https://www.seai.ie/plan-your-energy-journey/for-your-community?gad_source=1" target="_blank">
        SEAI Sustainable Energy Communities (SEC) programme
    </a>, which currently uses manual Excel-based reporting methods.
</p>

<h2>Current Workflow</h2>
<p>
    At present, SEC County Mentors—contractors engaged through a tendering process—are required to submit three separate documents each month:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An Excel sheet detailing planned and achieved person-days per community group</li>
    <li>A Word document summarizing their monthly activities</li>
    <li>An invoice (submitted in Word, PDF, or Excel format, depending on the contractor)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>
    This project aims to replace the current manual system with a modern, web-based solution. Key objectives include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Centralized and secure data entry and storage</li>
    <li>Improved productivity tracking and monitoring</li>
    <li>Automated reporting and insights</li>
    <li>User-friendly interface for both contractors and employers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits of the New System</h2>
<p>
    The application introduces a structured and integrated approach to contractor activity tracking, offering many benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eliminates repeated manual tasks</li>
    <li>Greater accuracy and consistency in reporting</li>
    <li>Improved transparency in contractor performance</li>
    <li>Automated report generation to support informed decision-making</li>
</ul>
